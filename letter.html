            <p><strong>Dear Kate,  I love you soooo much more than words could say really, I know times have been tough at time but I don't care because as long as were together I feel like we can handle anything, you are my favourite person ever and I'm so grateful for you for everything you do like coming to my games at ridiculous hours of the night or miles away in hull or billingham or coventry. Im sorry I haven't been able to come to many of your games but hopefully next season I will be able to come to many more. Im so happy we're now living together and I get to spend every second of my life with you by my side. I love doing things for you like cooking or carrying your stick or bag or doing anything because im doing it all for you. I love listening to you talk about your things that im not smart enough to get like mereiological nihilism or judiaic mysticism because I just like listening to your voice. I love you so much Kate Gleave you are my favourite person ever and im eternally grateful and unrevocably in love with you forever and ever.  </strong></p>
